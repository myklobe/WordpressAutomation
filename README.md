WordpressAutomation

===================



Wordpress Automation Base Framework based off of Pluralsight's Selenium Training Video


Note:
You will need a local copy of chromedriver and IEDriverServer to execute with Chrome or IE
-chromedriver.exe
-IEDriverServer.exe

IE and Selenium Drivers - http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/
There are links to both the 32 bit Windows IE Selenium Driver and C# Selenium Driver here

Chromedriver - https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver


The default path to the Selenium Drivers in the tests is: C:\Installs\Apps\seleniumdrivers

You will need to add these 2 files to your PATH in your native OS

Update your tests to the directory that holds your Selenium Drivers
